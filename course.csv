Specifically, this course will allow the student to explore the significance of pilgrimage by perfoming the actions of a pilgrim to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.  For over 1000 years, people of faith have traveled to the burial site of St. James in Santiago.  The routes to reach Santiago flourished in the medieval era, paths that were walked by princes, kings, and ordinary peasants.  As a result each town along the way to Santiago bears vivid material evidence through ecclesial art and architecture that speaks to the popularity of this practice.  Students will walk in their footsteps upon these well-trod routes, specifically focusing on the route in northern Spain.  By delving into this practice, students are expected to gain a deeper knowledge of the role of ritual practice in religion as well as an understanding of the continued significance of physical ritual in the contemporary world.

Course materials will attend the strategies of production and sale that shape not only how art is used and understood, but how such considerations influence the creation of styles and techniques that are more often identified as the products of individual creative expression.

The class attends to the historical development of technologies that directly impacted vision and representation, from linear perspective to the Hubble Space Telescope, from oil painting to holography.  By the same token, the relativity of ideals of aesthetic value will also be examined, from classical canons of proportion to the celebration of ostentation and material cost, from social realism to expressionism to abstraction."

ARH ,ARH 383     ,Social Life of Prints  ,A,UG16,"This course explores the various roles that printed images �C woodcuts, engravings and etchings �C played in the development of the visual arts since the Renaissance. For example, prints served as the most rapid form of mass communication (and propaganda); as a means to discreetly disseminate illicit or pornographic images; as scientific records of the natural world; and as affordable imitations of paintings or as a means to communicate visual motifs among artists. Perhaps most importantly, this course will consider the means by which prints stimulated the development of the visual and critical skills necessary to negotiate cultures that were increasingly saturated by images.

Moreover, these issues are reviewed within the historiography of the discipline as a means to encourage the self-conscious assessment of how the field of art history itself has laid claim to shifting strategies of authority."

Yet a simple difinition of portraiture remains maddeningly elusive. Moreover, its familiarity, rooted in its association with likeness �C the ability to match sitter with subject �C masks the fascinating and complex history of the genre.

Representations of the body constitute an essential platform for constructions of and challenges to our most fundamental understandings of being and identity, calling attention to issues of gender, race, class, death, and the afterlife. This course examines images of the human form across various cultural geographies and historical moments as a means to investigate how the body, through an almost infinite variety of means, has been used to explore the nature of the human condition."

These prints were also popular with both American and European collectors. In this course, we will examine and discuss techniques such as woodblock printing and lithography, and topics such as cultural sharing, assimilation, and appropriation.

ARH ,ARH 390     ,"Race, Photography, and America  ",A,UG16,"The events surrounding the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 have been photographed as much as any event in our history.  Photojournalists captured some of these images, but many were taken by local residents and posted on social media. These photos have not only offered a documentary record, but have served to illustrate the power of images to inform public opinion and to generate support and solidarity for a cause, often among those far from the location and circumstances of the original event. Photography has always had the potential to alter cultural patterns; specifically, photography was integral to the fight against racism and segregation, beginning with portraits of Sojourner Truth in the 1860s through photographs from the Civil Rights movement. This class will study the history of social photography and race through these images, and examine the medium as a visual language and an agent of communication. The course will involve a community-based learning component: we hope to facilitate several community conversations about photography and race."

Bishop has often been associated with ""reticence"": a woman's voice that is impersonal, restrained, not discussing gender, not expressing anger, not overtly political or positioned in relation to the male, and to a male tradition. Plath is often associated with the ""radical"" in women��s poetry: an explicit and embattled stance toward patriarchy and men, breaking taboos, self-dramatization, expressions of critique, anger, aggression, an attempt to redefine gendered social roles, deliberately breaking with conventions and expectations for women's voices and women's poetry. We'll explore their poetry and try to determine how such descriptions apply and what we can learn as a result, including study of the following: the conventions and expressive assumptions of women's poetry during the time they were writing, their own writing beyond poetry (letters, journals, fiction), the shifting tides of critical reception for both, including feminist response to both. For the last third of the class, we'll read contemporary poets who show their influence, including Kim Addonizio, Louise Gluck, Joanna Klink, Erica Dawson, and others. "

College is a phase of life in which individuals feel very proud of themselves, begin serious romantic relationships, and try to find their own identities.

Thus, those with highly positive self-views are tempted to utilize self-defense mechanisms when facing academic failure (e.g., self-handicapping and self-serving bias), which in turn leads to ineffective coping with personal issues. Alternatively, living an unsatisfactory personal life may lead to low academic achievement and cause students to lose their interest in continuing college education.

Have you ever wondered what are the fundamental components of nature and reality?  Is reality something we create or something of which we are a part?  Readings incorporate main areas of contemporary philosophy, among them: scientific realism, time, laws of nature, and causality.  Students engage the comtemporary literature and answer some of the following questions: Do physics and chemistry give us the only real properties of nature or is there more than the material world?  If all the properties that exist are the scientific ones (protons, electrons, neutrons, magnetic fields, etc.) then how do we understand or explain the every day objects we encounter, including ourselves and other human beings?  What does it mean to say that something exists, and exists as we perceive it?  Is there such a thing as time and if so, is it static or is it ever changing (for instance, the present)?  What does it mean to say that the laws of nature hold by necessity?  We seem to agree that scientific laws are explanatory, but what makes them explanatory?"

POL ,POL 454     ,Environmental Governance &Policy  ,A,UG16,"This course explores the myriad ways that humans have attempted to govern their natural environments, solving issues of access and environmental degradation through various framings of the relationship between nature and society. As such, we will explore many alternatives for governing the commons across both time and space ? from local taboos and kin?based cooperatives to emerging proposals for global climate governance. Today we are bearing witness to the increasing spread of neo?liberal forms of environmental governance around the world. These models support market?based solutions to environmental problems. Within this framework, resources such as water, timber and land are commodified and their management turned over to the market. However, environmental governance is neither monolithic nor universal as we will discover through a number of case studies which suggest that hybrid forms of environmental governance are emerging in many different international contexts. We will consider how agencies and actors (both local and global, human and non?human) impact the constitution of governance and how governance is enacted through environmental policy. "

In particular, we will examine how the border is constructed on film through the influence of historical, political, and cultural phenomena such as immigration, the War on Drugs, and the shifting dynamics of economic globalization. In doing so, we will necessarily question representations of Latin@ peoples and cultures, gender, and violence in an attempt to delineate how these media have shaped the way we think about the border, immigrants, labor, sexuality, and other topics as they emerge. Some films to be included are Alambrista (1977), No Country for Old Men (2007), Sleep Dealer (2008), and Precious Knowledge (2011). Films will be in English and Spanish. Prerequisite: SPA 250."
